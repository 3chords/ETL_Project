Overview:

- Our ETL project will be combining two CSV files of commercial real estate statistics 
with labor statistics at the metro level into one table that allows the end user to
do a time series analysis using indicators from both tables. We will be using 
a relational database to build these tables.

Steps for ETL project

- Combine tables on geography (find a way to match using non-matching geographies)
- Use the CRE stats table as the guide, we want to keep all rows in the CRE stats table and 
only bring in those records that match from the labor data.
- We will bring the labor data into the cre stats table so that each time series data point
in a row.
- The labor table data only goes back to 2001 so we need to remove any pre-2001 rows
from the CRE stats table.
- When data is not available we will replace with nulls
- The data in the labor file is yearly. The data in the CRE stats file is quarterly. We want to 
eliminate all non Q4 rows in the CRE table because the Q4 data is a snapshot.
- We may need to identify any columns where there is text and clean it out (e.g. % or commas)
- We need to create a new 'year' column in the final table
- We will develop a master table with all metrics
- We will develop sub-tables or views with key grouped metrics for easier reporting.


Process thoughts:
- We will probably need to use a combination of text-to-columns and concatenation
like operations on each table independently first to enable the geography key to match.
